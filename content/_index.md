# Building an Event Ticketing Web App with AWS Amplify

The **"Building an Event Ticketing Web App with AWS Amplify"** workshop is part of the AWS Workshop Studio.  

Although this workshop is not overly complex, I chose it because it includes all the essential steps to deploy a modern web system using a serverless architecture.

This workshop is a practical example that clearly demonstrates how AWS supports backend deployment (GraphQL API, Cognito, DynamoDB...) in combination with frontend technologies (VueJS) in a fast, efficient, and real-world manner.

It not only helped me strengthen my technical skills but also gave me a broader understanding of modern cloud-based application development models. Therefore, I decided to redo the workshop and provide more detailed explanations of the structure, helping beginners like myself understand how each component interacts and the reasoning behind each step.

I hope this report not only documents what I have completed, but also serves as a **clear and helpful guide** for students who are new to AWS or are exploring serverless and modern application architectures.
