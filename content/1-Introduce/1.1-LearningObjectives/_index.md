The **"Building an Event Ticketing Web App with AWS Amplify"** workshop is designed to help learners:

- Understand the process of deploying a **modern full-stack web application**
- Get familiar with **serverless architecture** on the **AWS cloud platform**

### Knowledge and Skills Acquired

The application is built following a modern development model:

- **Frontend:** Built with Vue.js  
- **Backend:** Powered by AWS Amplify and services like:
  - **AWS AppSync (GraphQL API)**

- Develop a real-world web application from frontend to backend
- Integrate **user authentication** using Amazon Cognito
- Fetch and update data via **GraphQL API**
- Manage app state using **Pinia**
- Work with real-world data models like `Event`, `Room`, and `Ticket`
- Design a system that is **scalable**, **cost-effective**, and **maintainable**
- Deploy a fully **serverless backend**, aligning with modern application development trends
