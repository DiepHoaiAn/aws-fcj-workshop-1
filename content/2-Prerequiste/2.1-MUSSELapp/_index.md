In this step, you will run the sample MUSSEL application on localhost and explore its interface, behavior, and mock data. This provides the foundation for understanding how the frontend works before integrating it with a real backend.

---

### Launch the Application

After completing the clone and installation steps (from the previous section), run the following command to start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```
After a few seconds, you should see the following output:
```
  Vite v4.6.0  ready in 300 ms

  ➜ Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜ Network: use `--host` to expose
```
→ Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to start exploring.

### Main Interface

When you successfully access the app, it displays a list of events. The interface includes:

- **Top navigation bar (App Bar)** with buttons: switch theme, info, sign in.
- **Event list**: shows mock sample events.
- **Bottom navigation bar** with 3 tabs: Past Events, My Tickets, Upcoming Events.

### User Flow Experience

#### When Not Signed In

- **Sign In** button appears at the top right.
- **My Tickets** button is disabled.
- You cannot book tickets for any event.

If you try clicking the `Book Ticket` button, the system will show a message: **Sign in to book tickets**

{{% notice info %}}
The data shown is *mock data* – generated each time you run `npm run dev`, covering events from **2 days ago to 2 days ahead** of the current date.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Simulated Login

Currently, the sign-in feature is **simulated (mock login)**. To test:

1. Click the **Sign In** button.
2. Enter any name in the dialog (e.g., `alice`).
3. After signing in:
   - The **My Tickets** tab becomes enabled.
   - You can book tickets for upcoming events.
   - Clicking **My Tickets** shows your booked events.

Simulated login allows you to test the user flow before integrating real authentication with Amazon Cognito.

### AI-Generated Data

The event images and descriptions in the mock data are generated by **Generative AI**, using **Amazon Bedrock** and **Amazon Titan**.

- Successfully run the **MUSSEL** app locally.
- Understood how the UI works with mock data.
- Experienced the user flow: **sign in**, **book tickets**, **view booked tickets**.
